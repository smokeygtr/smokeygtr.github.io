At OSSCON this past weekend, my team and I were able to take advantage of this wonderful opportunity in their annual *Capture The Flag* competition. We're pleased to announce that we achieved **3rd place** overall, tied with 2nd, among teams from top universities such as UCI, CSULB, CSUF, CSULA, and many others. This podium placement rewarded us with an *ACI exam voucher*, which I plan to use as a chance to advance my skills. I was fortunate to work with two amazing teammates -- Ryan Wong and Jordan Crow.

**Physical lock picking, steganography, network traffic analysis, decryption, web testing, and many Linux fundamentals** were some of the obstacles that we had to overcome. A majority of these were based on red teaming techniques, requiring quick thinking, strong collaboration, adaptability, time management, and efficiency under pressure. 

This experience not only enhanced my technical skills but also improved my teamwork and communication in high-pressure environments. Overall, I'm proud of what my team and I achieved here and am excited to build on this success in upcoming competitions.
