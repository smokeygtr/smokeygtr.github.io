# Hi!
My name is Aidan Chen, an aspiring 'Red Teamer' from California. 

I'm currently an undergraduate student at Cal Poly Pomona studying in the field of computer science, pursuing cybersecurity. I'm leaning towards the offensive security side of things due to the amount of excitement that it brings. This page is highlighted towards my accomplishments and and journey in learning more about this field.
